I worked
		on it as a senior full stack developer designing and implementing the technical solutions. I
		spent the most time on the front end of the web application which was the most complex part of
		the project.</p> <h3>Some achievements</h3> <ul><li>Executed a comprehensive restructuring of the project's mono-repo architecture using <a href="https://melos.invertase.dev/"><code>melos</code></a>, resulting in a 50% reduction in build, 10x reduction in code generation, and improved
			scalability.</li> <li>Achieved a 40% reduction in loading time by optimizing front-end development processes using <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod"><code>riverpod</code></a> and <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/go_router"><code>go_router</code></a>.</li> <li>Designed and developed a code generation tool for text key localization, effectively
			identifying and preventing 100% of missing translation key bugs in production.</li> <li>Integrated payment and subscription features, resulting in a 50% increase in revenue within
			six months.</li> <li>Implemented a company wide Quality Assurance (QA) process and Continuous Integration (CI)
			framework, leading to a 50% decrease in bug reports and 30% faster deployment cycles.</li> <li>Established standardized protocols for code quality and consistency, resulting in a 40%
			decrease in code review time and increase in developer productivity.</li> <li>Overhauled the GraphQL API and PostgreSQL database, enhancing safety, relevance, and
			performance, resulting in a 15% decrease of the project code size.</li> <li>Code reviews and consultation on possible issues and edge cases reducing 10% of possible
			regression issues.</li> <li>Breaking down the user stories and estimations achieving near 100% project goals on time.</li> <li>Implemented the main and most used and complex feature of the application: the form template
			builder. Similar to Google forms, it allow the user to define a form's structure and then
			create and fill several instances of it.</li> <li>Optimized <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/themes">Flutter's theme</a> mechanism
			for consistent theming, and led end-to-end migration from Material Design 2 to Material Design
			3</li></ul></article>`,1);function S(l){var e=b();u("1yktkte",w=>{m(()=>{f.title="Valentin Vignal - Novade"})});var t=n(h(e),2),a=i(t);g(a);var o=n(a,2),d=i(o);v(d,{src:"https://lite.novade.net/icons/favicon.png",title:"Novade Lite"}),s(o),r(2),s(t),r(2),c(l,e)}export{S as component};
