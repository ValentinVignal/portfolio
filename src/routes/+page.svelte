	<p>Hello! I'm Valentin Vignal.</p>

	<p>
		I'm a full-stack developer and I'm currently working at <a href="https://www.novade.net/"

		>
		in Singapore.
	</p>
	<p>
		Passionate about software development, architecture and building tools for developers. I prefer
		quality over quantity. Most experienced Flutter, Svelte and NestJS.
	</p>

	<p>
		I'm a constant learner and enjoy keeping up to date with new technologies.
		<br />
		I prioritize honest and straightforward communication over dealing with challenging office politics,
		focusing instead on achieving tangible results rather than engaging in excessive discussions. However,
		I do appreciate having a well-defined plan in place.
